    description: "Gentleness is your greatest strength and you are a nurturer at heart, just like Parvati! Shiva's wife and his first disciple, Parvati is known for her benevolence, compassion, strength and an intense love that can even turn ferocious. When she expressed her desire to learn the science of yoga from Shiva, he simply included her as a part of himself, taking on the form of Ardhanarishvara – a perfect balance of masculine and feminine.",

  "Nandi": {
    name: "Nandi",
    title: "The Steadfast Companion",
    description: "Patience is your best quality, and you're always content to \"just be\" (without falling asleep of course), just like Nandi! This bull, often depicted in sculptures outside of Shiva temples, has been called Shiva's closest accomplice. His quality of waiting is held as a great virtue, as this ability to simply remain alert and wait without any expectation is the key to receptivity. In the Yogic culture, Nandi is a symbol of meditativeness.",

    title: "The Wise Scholar",
    description: "You always have a book in one hand, a snack in the other, and a few tricks up your sleeve, just like Ganapati! Ganapati, or Ganesha, is revered as a remover of obstacles. He gained his distinctive appearance when Shiva cut off his head and then replaced it with the head of a gana. Famed for his insatiable appetite, he is celebrated on Ganesh Chaturti with delicious treats. But beyond his big belly, Ganapati also boasts an impressive brain. He is admired for his wisdom and for transcribing the epic Mahabharat using his own tusk.",

    name: "The Ganas",
    title: "The Boisterous Band",
    description: "Your life is bursting with joy from within, even though no one else understands you, just like the ganas! The ganas are Shiva's gang of celestial companions. They speak to Shiva in a cacophony of sounds that no one else around can understand, and their appearance is similarly inscrutable – they are often described as distorted, with boneless limbs sprouting from odd places on their bodies. This truly motley crew can be found intoxicated and dancing exuberantly with Shiva.",

These seven sages proved themselves worthy of receiving Shiva's knowing after 84 years of intense sadhana. After Shiva transmitted 112 tools for transformation to them, they set out in different directions across the globe, raising human consciousness around the planet. Their impact can still be seen and felt in the consecrated spaces they created and in more subtle ways that have seeped into the daily life of the cultures they touched.",

Shiva's son is known by many names, including Muruga, Kumara, Skanda, and Subrahmanya. He is revered as a powerful warrior. Though he never held a kingdom, he fought across the continent seeking to wipe out injustice before finally realizing that violence is not the answer.",
